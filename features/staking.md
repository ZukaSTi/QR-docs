## What Is Staking?

**Staking** is a way to earn on cryptocurrency. You "deposit" tokens into a DeFi protocol and receive income as interest (APY — Annual Percentage Yield).

Analogy: staking is like a bank deposit, but on the blockchain — with transparent terms and no middlemen.

## FAQ

**Can I lose funds?**
Smart contract risk exists theoretically, but we only use audited protocols (AAVE, Compound, Lido). Risk level is displayed for each pool.

**When do I earn?**
Earnings accrue continuously in real time. You see balance growth right in the app.

**Can I withdraw anytime?**
Depends on the protocol. Most pools support instant withdrawal. Lido (stETH) may require waiting or exchanging on a DEX.
