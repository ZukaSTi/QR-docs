## Unified Balance

## Token List

Below the balance — a list of all your tokens with current prices and 24h change:

- **Name and network** — e.g., USDC on Base
- **Balance** — amount and USD equivalent
- **Price change** — over the last 24 hours in %
- **Network icon** — for quick identification

Tokens are sorted by USD value — highest first.
