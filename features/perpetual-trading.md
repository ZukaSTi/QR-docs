> Trade with leverage — longs and shorts on crypto right from the wallet.

## What Are Perpetuals?

**Perpetual Futures (perps)** are perpetual futures contracts. You can:

- **Long** — profit from price going up
- **Short** — profit from price going down
- Use **leverage** up to the asset's maximum

Unlike regular futures, perpetuals have no expiration date — the position stays open until you close it or liquidation occurs.
