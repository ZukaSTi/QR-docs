## QR Wallet Integration

### Separate Address
Unlike EVM networks, Solana uses its own address format (Base58). Your Solana address is **different** from your EVM Smart Account address.

### Swap
Token exchange on Solana via **Jupiter** — Solana's largest aggregator:
- Access to all SPL tokens
- Instant execution
- Minimal slippage

### Staking
SOL staking via **Marinade Finance**:
- Liquid staking: SOL → mSOL
- Earn without locking funds
- Use mSOL in DeFi

### Cross-Chain
Transfer tokens between Solana and EVM networks via Rango — bridge aggregator.

### Gas Sponsorship
Solana uses a separate sponsorship mechanism — via fee payer. QR Wallet can sponsor fees on Solana, similar to EVM networks.
