## Unique Features

### Fee Model: Energy and Bandwidth

Unlike EVM networks, Tron doesn't use classic "gas." Instead:

- **Bandwidth** — free allowance for simple TRX transfers
- **Energy** — needed for smart contract interactions (USDT transfers, TRC-20 tokens)

Energy can be obtained by staking TRX. Without staking — you pay TRX as a fee.

### Separate Address
Tron uses its own address format (`T...`). Your Tron address differs from EVM and Solana addresses.
