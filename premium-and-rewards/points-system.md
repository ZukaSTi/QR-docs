## How It Works

Every day you can earn points for using QR Wallet. Points are awarded for various actions — from simply opening the app to completing swaps and staking.

---

## Daily Limit

Every user has a **daily limit** that depends on their tier and bonuses:

| Source | Points/day |
|--------|:----------:|
| **Base limit** | 1,000 – 3,500 (by tier) |
| **Hunter NFT** | +500 |
| **OG NFT** | +500 |
| **Staking ≥ $500** | +500 |
| **Maximum** | **5,000** |

### Example

User with Year + Hunter NFT + $600 staked:
- Base: 2,500
- Hunter NFT: +500
- Staking: +500
- **Total: 3,500 points/day**
