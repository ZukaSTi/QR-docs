## FAQ

**Can I extend Premium?**
Yes. You can buy a new period before the current one expires — time stacks.

**What happens when Premium expires?**
You return to the Free tier. Activated SAs remain active — that's a one-time action.

**Can I buy Premium with fiat?**
Crypto only for now. Fiat payment is planned.
