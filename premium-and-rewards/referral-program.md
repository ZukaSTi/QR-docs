# Referral Program

> Invite friends — earn together.

---

## How It Works

Every QR Wallet user gets a **unique referral link**. Share it — and earn rewards for every friend who joins.

---

## Two Referral Levels

| Level | Who | What You Get |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| **Level 1** | Your direct referrals | Cashback % from their operations |
| **Level 2** | Your referrals' referrals | Smaller cashback % |

This means: if you invited Alice, and Alice invited Bob — you earn cashback from both Alice (Level 1) and Bob (Level 2).

---

## Referral Code

You have **two types** of referral codes:

1. **Standard code** — auto-generated at registration
2. **Username code** — if you set a username, it becomes your referral code

Both codes can be shared as links.

## Statistics

The referral section displays:

- **Total referrals** — total number invited
- **Active referrals** — those actively using the wallet
- **Total cashback** — how much you've earned
- **Level 1 / Level 2** — breakdown by level

## Cashback
